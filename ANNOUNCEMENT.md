# Introducing the All-New PortMaster: Your Ultimate Handheld Linux Port Manager

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the new PortMaster, a complete overhaul of our port management program designed to provide you with an exceptional experience when installing, updating, and uninstalling Ports on your handheld Linux devices. The original PortMaster was built around the limited bash command 'console,' but now, we're introducing a game-changing solution with a multitude of new features and improvements that we think you'll love!

# What's New in PortMaster?

## Beautiful Custom GUI
Gone are the days of working with a command line interface. PortMaster boasts a fully custom GUI using Python SDL2 bindings, making navigation and control a breeze.

## Compact and Lightweight
PortMaster is incredibly efficient, with a download size of just 8MB. Say goodbye to bulky software that eats up your device's storage.

## Port Previews
Discover Ports like never before with our new port preview feature. Get a sneak peek of what's in store, making it easier to choose the perfect Ports for your device.

## Cancellable Downloads
Ever accidentally started a massive download? No worries! PortMaster allows you to cancel downloads, so you can avoid wasting time and data on unwanted files.

## Enhanced Port Management
Filter Ports by genre, runtime, update availability, and installation status, and sort them by name, recent additions, or recent updates for a more organized experience.

## Localization Support
PortMaster is available in multiple languages, including English, Italian, French, German, and Polish. We welcome contributions from translators to make it even more accessible to users around the world. [Contributions can be made through our Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/portmaster).

## Runtime Manager
Manage runtimes seamlessly within PortMaster. You can install, update, verify, and uninstall runtimes directly through the program.

# Introducing PortMaster Themes

PortMaster now supports customizable themes. With multiple color schemes for dark mode, light mode, and unique color variations, you can tailor the program to your preferences. We even have a built-in theme downloader for your convenience. Our initial theme lineup includes:

- **Default Theme**: Available in both light and dark modes.
- **Zelda**: Inspired by the aesthetics of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
- **FF VII**: A visually stunning theme inspired by Final Fantasy VII.
- **Basic Theme**: A minimalist theme, perfect for those who want to design their own.

# New PortMaster Installer

We've simplified the installation process with a self-contained PortMaster installer, which is itself a basic port. This installer will self-extract and place all the necessary files in the right locations to ensure a hassle-free installation on any known CFW. Installing PortMaster is now a straightforward two-step process, and it also includes fixes for JELOS and its version of PortMaster.

# Brand New Website and Wiki

We've been hard at work building a brand new website for PortMaster at https://portmaster.games/. This site includes an extensive wiki with screenshots for each port, updated documentation, and tools to assist in creating new Ports.

# Join the PortMaster Discord Community

We've also launched a dedicated PortMaster Discord community. It has become a bustling hub for port enthusiasts, where you can stay updated on the latest port developments, seek assistance with ports, get help with PortMaster-related issues, or even collaborate and receive feedback on creating your own ports. [Join our Discord community today](https://discord.gg/m2QcSkMh).

# Under the Hood Improvements

We've made significant enhancements under the hood. Say goodbye to the manual editing of ports.md; it has been replaced by the more advanced ports.json format. This format provides a wealth of information for each port and is now generated automatically by the ports themselves. We've even developed a tool that automates the creation of the port.json file for your convenience.
